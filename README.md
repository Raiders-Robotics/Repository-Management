# Repository-Management

Some helpful tips for creating &amp; managing repos for Robotics code!

### Forking the Official FTC SDK

At the start of a new season we want to make sure we start fresh with the most up-to-date SDK that FTC provides. To do this, go to the Official [FTC SDK Repo](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) and create a fork in our [Raider Robotics](https://github.com/Raiders-Robotics) Github organization.

Following naming conventions, the new repository should be named the same as the game name (i.e. PowerPlay, FreightFrenzy, etc.)

### Synching Forked Repositories

When FTC releases new versions we want to make sure we are able to incorporate the updates. The following steps should be considered:

1. Read the [changelogs](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/releases) to identify any breaking changes that may affect the robot code written by the team.

2. Find the `Sync fork` button on the fork that needs updated
   - Github will try to incorporate the changes automatically, however, if conflicts arise you will be prompted to open a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).
